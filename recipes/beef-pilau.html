    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>

    <p>Pilau is a flavorful rice dish that is commonly eaten in East Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as in other parts of the world such as the Middle East and South Asia. It is typically made by cooking rice with a variety of aromatic spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper, often with meat such as beef, chicken, or goat. The dish is known for its rich, savory taste, which comes from the combination of spices and the broth used to cook the rice.</p>
    <p>This pilau takes inspiration from swahili-Indian pilaus and so usually I add fresh chilis which are optional and potatoes (which is essential for a swahili pilau) but if you omit them, dont worry it will still be a pilau… For this particular pilau I opted for sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes which tastes just as good if not better.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

    <li>Start with the beef. In a sufuria add all the ingridients for the meat and simmer on low heat for about 1-2 hours or until the meat is tender soft and is justabout falling off the bone. Use a pressure cooker to speed up the process approx 30minutes.</li> 
    <li>Heat oil in large sauce pan(sufuria), add onions and fry until they start to turn  slightly brown</li>
    <li>Next, add all your dry whole spices, the ginger, garlic stir and fry on medium-high heat until the mixture is aromatic and turns completely brown (Be very careful not to burn the onion mix) ensure you keep stirring and regulate your heat if you feel it is too high.</li>
    <li>Throw in the sweet potatoes, little water about 1/4 a cup just to steam the potatoes and give them a head start. cover and simmer for a few minutes 3-5.</li>
    <li>Then add the tomato paste, pilau masala powder , boiled beef, stir well and cook for a minute or two</li>
    <li>Add the rice and stir gently ensuring you do not break the rice, ensure each grain of rice is well coated with the spices and oil</li>
    <li>Pour in the liquid which should be a total of 4 cups inclusive of the beef broth and water.</li>
    <li>Bring to boil check seasoning, add salt at this stage if need be.</li>
    <li>Cover and simmer on low heat for 20min or until rice is fully cooked.</li>
