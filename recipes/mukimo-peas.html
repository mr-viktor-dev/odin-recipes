    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>Mukimo is a kenyan dish which mainly originates from the kikuyu community. It comprises of maize, potatoes, peas and salt. Peas are sometimes normally expensive and can be substituted with kahurura (pumpkin leaves) as is regularly done in Kenyan households. Pumpkin leaves tend to be cheaper and a little goes along way in terms of the green colour. After boiling and mashing, muklimo can be enjoyed as is, or you can take it a further step and elevate by frying it with some onions, butter or margarine.</p>
